  TypeScript can be used for runtime request validation, this makes your backend app more secure and reliable.

  Custom decorators can extract request params, do auth, method interception, modify request results and lots of powerful jobs.

- **One Complied Code, Deploy Everywhere**<br/>
  Summer use esbuild to pack code into ONE runnable js file. This compiled code is compatible to deploy in Kubernetes cluster or Serverless without changing any configuration.

- **Best Swagger Integration**<br/>
  Summer Swagger plugin utilizes runtime typescript to generate API documents ( OpenAPI 3.0.x ), a single line of code can generate a full document. The Swagger plugin works together with Summer core decorators that can read @Max() Optional(?) and database column comments in TypeORM.
